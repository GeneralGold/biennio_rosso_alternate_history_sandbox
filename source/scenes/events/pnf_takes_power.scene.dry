= [+ pnf_leader +] Appointed Prime Minister!

The March on Rome has succeeded, as the threat of violence and outright civil war forces the King to give in to [+ pnf_leader +]'s demands. Vittorio Emanuele III has officially appointed [+ pnf_leader +] as Prime Minister, as many fear he will quickly consolidate power and bring the full force of the government towards us.

[+ pnf_leader +] has already formed a governing coalition of the PNF, PPI, PLI and DS.

What are we to do now?

- @fight: Mobilise the Red Guards and authorise workers to begin taking up arms against [+ pnf_leader +]'s rule!
- @keep_on: Await our opportunity to strike.


@fight

Do we realize that this means civil war, against the full force of the state?

- @civil_war: Yes.
- @keep_on: We are not ready for war. Instead, we will continue to struggle and await our opportunity.

We will continue onwards, biding our time. We are facing an extremely uphill battle, and will have to act fast.
